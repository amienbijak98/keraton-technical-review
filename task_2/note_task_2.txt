1. I create just one table, and I think that's enough for inputying each course exam score.

2. The 'exam_date' column is clearly for recording the date of the exam.

3. The 'number_semester' column is for recording the semester number. Like 1, 2, ..., 8 etc.

4. The 'exam_period' column is to recording option such as 'mid-semester' or 'end-semester' or another period.
If the 'exam_period' option is more than 5 or maybe the examp period has a certain description or rule,
we should create another reference table specifically for the exam period.

5. 'student_ID' is also for record the student who took the exam. We only need the ID because we can
create queries for more advance results or analytics.

6. Number 5 is also applies to 'course_ID'. These two columns can be the "key" to make queries
based on these columns.

7. And lastly, the 'score' column is obviously for recording the score.

8. So there is 2 foreign key that we need: one for student and one for course table.

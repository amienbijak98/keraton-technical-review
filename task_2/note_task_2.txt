1. I create just one table, and I think that's enough for simple inputting each course exam score.
If we need more complex data like assignment or/and quiz score, I think we need to add more table
specifically for recording all score including mid and exam score.

2. The 'number_semester' column is for recording the semester number. Like 1, 2, ..., 8 etc.

3. The 'mid/end_exam_date' column is clearly for recording the date of each exam.

4. The 'mid/end_exam_score' column is clearly for recording the score of each exam.

5. 'student_id' is also for record the student who took the exam. We only need the 'id' because we can
create queries for more advance results or analytics.

6. Number 5 is also applies to 'course_id'. These two columns can be the "key" to make queries
based on these columns.

7. And lastly, the 'final_score' column is obviously for recording the final_score.
It is generated column, made for simplify the design.

8. So there is 2 foreign key that we need: one for student and one for course table.

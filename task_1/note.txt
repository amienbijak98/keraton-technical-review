1. First, make sure my connection with PostgreSQL is well established.
Then, Login into my default Postgres username.

2. Then I create database in PostgreSQL schema like this
'~postgres=# CREATE DATABASE keraton_academy'.

3. I should select my database from the first time,
because we cannot select database with SQL syntax (USE [database_name]) like other SQL.
I use DBeaver, so I set my connected database as "keraton_academy".

4. Then I write the SQL syntax file.

5. I use 'IF NOT EXISTS' to prevent errors if I run
the SQL file more than once because there is only one
table at a time in one database.

6. For ID, I just named it with "ID" for ease me when later I use GORM (Golang ORM)
that use "ID" for default primary key. I also use 'serial' to make ID's auto increment.

7. 'Varchar(n)' is to limit length of the data so we can save more
storage or memory for the system. The same applies to with SMALLINT but it's for
number lenght or max data. The starting_year actually only need 4 digit number,
similar to credit points, which only use not more than 2-3 digit number per course.

8. The 'NOT NULL' information is for stricting the incoming data to avoid negligence
that sends nothing. However, I allow the city column to be null because it's not as important
as the other columns. Not all columns need to be filled with data.

9. In the course table, I set the 'lecturer_id' column with integer data.
because 'serial' is same as integer but without auto increment feature. In this table,
we don't need auto increment becuase we use this column as foreign key constraint.

10. The last statement in creating the course table, I write constraint with its object
(foreign key and references) to make the 'lecturer_id' column in this course table
connected or have relation with the lecturer table. The releationship is
one (lecturer) to many (courses)

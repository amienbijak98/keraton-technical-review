1. First, makesure my connection with postgres is well established.
Then, Login into my default postgres' username.

2. Then I create db (database) in PostgreSQL Schema like this
~postgres=# CREATE DATABASE keraton_academy

3. I should select my database from the first time,
because we cannot select database with SQL syntax (USE [database_name]) like other SQL.
I use DBeaver so I set my connected db is "keraton_academy"

4. Then I write the sql syntax file.

5. I use 'IF NOT EXISTS' to prevent error if I run
the SQL file more than once. Because there is only one
table at a time in one database.

6. I use serial to make ID's auto increment

7. Varchar(n) is to limit lenght of the data. So we can save more
storage or memory for the system. Same with SMALLINT but it for
number lenght/max data. The starting_year actually only need 4 digit number.
Same with the credit points that only use not more than 2-3 digit number per course

8. The NOT NULL information is for stricting the incoming data. To avoid negligence
that sent nothing. But I allow city column to be null because it's not as important
as the other column. Not all column need to be filled with data.

9. In the course table, I set the lecturer_ID column with integer data.
because serial is same with integer, but no auto increment feature. And in this table
we don't need auto increment, becuase we use this column as foreign key constraint.

10. The last statement in create course table, I write Constraint with its object
(foreign key and references) to make the lecturer_ID column in this course table,
to be connected/have relation with the lecturer table.
The releation is one (lecturer) to many (course)
